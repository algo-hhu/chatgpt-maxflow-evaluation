v1 = generic version
v2 = reserve memory
v3 = Layer Skipping 
v4 = Capacity Scaling 
v5 = Dynamic Level Graph Updates (DLGU) 
v6 = v5 + parallel BFS (compile with -ltbb), tbb library necessary


MemoryPools = v4 + Memory Pools + own Memory management (no improvement, because the time to read in the graph is not included in the calculation time)
v2 = still got tested because ChatGPT said that it supposedly would still be an improvement for the computation  time because of better cache management.
dinitzEdgeSorting = sorts Edges in DFS (very slow, not used in the thesis by ChatGPT recommendation)
